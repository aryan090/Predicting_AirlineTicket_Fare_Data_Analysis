Airline Ticket Fare Prediction

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict airline ticket fares based on various features and factors. The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the cost of airline tickets, which can be beneficial for both airlines and passengers. The project involves thorough data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

### Project Overview
Airline ticket fares are influenced by a multitude of factors, including departure and arrival locations, flight duration, time of booking, class of service, and more. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict ticket fares based on these features. The project follows a structured approach:

Data Collection: Obtain a comprehensive dataset containing historical airline ticket information. This data may include departure and arrival airports, flight timings, cabin class, number of stops, and fare details.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from the available features, such as creating new features like day of the week, month, and season of travel.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Visualizations can help identify correlations between different features and the fare prices.

Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features for building the prediction model. Feature importance techniques and correlation analysis can guide this process.

Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks. Common algorithms to consider include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train the selected models. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

Model Deployment: Once the best model is selected, deploy it in a production-like environment where users can input flight details, and the model will predict the fare. This can be achieved using a web-based interface or an API.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation detailing the steps taken throughout the project, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and deployment. Include explanations of the chosen algorithms and evaluation metrics.
